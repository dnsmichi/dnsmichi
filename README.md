# Hi, I'm Michael aka dnsmichi

I'm a [Senior Developer Evangelist at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#dnsmichi), diving deep into all stages of the One DevOps platform. My focus areas are Ops, Observability, SRE in cloud-native environments ðŸ¦Š 

Everything I learn on my journey is shared in blog posts, talks, workshops, live streams, newsletters, public issues and social media. I'm one of the founders of the [#EveryoneCanContribute cafe](https://everyonecancontribute.com/), a social tech coffee chat to learn together ðŸ’¡
