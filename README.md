# Hi, I'm Michael aka dnsmichi

I'm a [Senior Developer Evangelist at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#dnsmichi), diving deep into all stages of the DevOps platform. 🦊 

I was a backend developer for an OSS monitoring tool from 2009-2020, and share a passion for educating everyone with Monitoring, Observability, SRE in cloud native adventures. Before that I used to manage and monitor the DNS infrastructure at the University of Vienna, hence my nickname. 🏗

Everything I learn on my journey is shared in blog posts, talks, workshops, live streams, newsletters, public issues and social media. I'm one of the founders of the [#EveryoneCanContribute cafe](https://everyonecancontribute.com/), a social tech coffee chat to learn together 💡
